## Run instruction

### If on Windows, type:

set FLASK_APP=app.py
python -m flask run

## Description 

Once you run Flask and click into the link, just key in the directory you want the files to be cleaned.

Eg. You key in the link of DIR_A. The output CSV files will be saved in DIR_B and DIR_C.

## Some possible improvements to the code: 

Data can be further cleaned where necessary eg. check Race, Names, etc 
Possibly add a decryption function too
To add a warning if no CSV files are found, or to check if input_dir is valid
Store the encryption key better
Add styles.css for the web page
